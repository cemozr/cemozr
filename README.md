### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Cem. I'm a computer engineer, who currently focused on frontend development. I tried game development, information security, database design and management, web development and other staff during my university years. Then I picked frontend as my main tech stack. Because It is so nice to see what you done immediately while you coding.
